=== kgio 2.4.1 - Kgio.poll avoids EINTR, really / 2011-05-21 02:54 UTC

  This release fixes a race condition that could allow
  Errno::EINTR to be raised even though the 2.4.0 release
  was supposed to stop that.

  Nobody uses Kgio.poll, really, so this shouldn't be an issue
  for real code, yet.
